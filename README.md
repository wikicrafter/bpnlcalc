#### Keep in mind that this is still a simplified version and may not fully replicate Binance's exact calculations but I try my best!
#### 

#### Calculate Initial Investment:
This is the amount of money you initially invest in the trade.

#### Calculate Leverage Multiplier:
Convert the leverage ratio to a multiplier: 1 + (leverage / 100).

#### Calculate Contract Quantity:
Divide the initial investment by the entry price and multiply by the leverage multiplier: (initialInvestment / entryPrice) * leverageMultiplier.

#### Calculate Entry and Exit Values:
Multiply the contract quantity by the entry and exit prices to get the total value at entry and exit: entryValue = contractQuantity * entryPrice, exitValue = contractQuantity * exitPrice.

#### Calculate Profit or Loss:
The profit or loss is the difference between the exit value and entry value: profitLoss = exitValue - entryValue.

#### Calculate Funding Cost:
Funding costs are commonly associated with perpetual contracts and are calculated based on the funding rate and the duration the position is held: fundingCost = (entryValue + exitValue) * (fundingRate / 100) * (daysHeld / 365).

#### Calculate Trading Fee:
Trading fees are calculated as a percentage of the total value of the trade: totalTradingFee = (entryValue + exitValue) * (tradingFee / 100).

#### Calculate Total Costs:
Sum up all the costs, including trading fees and funding costs: totalCosts = totalTradingFee + fundingCost.
